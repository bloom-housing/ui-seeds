## Best Practices

### When to Use

- Use this component to add visual cues and enhance the user experience in interfaces such as buttons, navigation, and other interactive elements.

### When Not to Use

- Do not use this component for non-iconographic content, such as images or illustrations.

### Usability

- Use icons that are easily recognizable and have a clear meaning. Avoid using icons that are abstract or metaphorical.
- Use the correct icon according to the context, meaning, and action associated with the element.

### Content Guidelines

- Use only for specific needs that are not covered by the Font Awesome icon set. Otherwise, use the Icon component instead.

### Accessibility Notes

- Use the `aria-hidden` attribute for purely decorative icons that do not convey any information.
- Provide a text alternative for icons that convey information, such as using an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute.
- Ensure that the icons are visible and can be easily distinguished by users with low vision or color blindness.
- Avoid using only icons to convey information, as it can be difficult for users who rely on assistive technologies to understand the meaning of the icons.
