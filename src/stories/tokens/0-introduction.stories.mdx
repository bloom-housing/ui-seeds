# Design Tokens

Tokens are predefined units of color, typography, spacing, and more that form a design language and can be customized to meet the needs of a specific context.

## Introduction to Design Tokens

Websites are built from elements of style including color, spacing, typography, line height, and opacity. The CSS rules associated with these elements can accept a broad continuum of values. 

Design tokens are a limited set of discrete options, just like a scale of musical notes drawn from the spectrum of all possible frequencies.

## Using the Design Tokens

Use design tokens, directly to set the value of settings variables in the theme settings files.
